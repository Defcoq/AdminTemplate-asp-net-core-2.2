# AdminTemplate-asp-net-core-2.2
this all in one solution following this great tutorial https://codinginfinite.com/creating-admin-panel-asp-net-core-mvc-tutorial/
I have include the hospital_db with all table in all the tutorial from the beginning to the end. when you launch the site you go directly to the login page and when you are login you can make all the crud for admin, role, and doctors, you can see that the dashboard is working as well. the menu like they do in this tutorial is build dynamically reading data directly from MYSQL.
Also check to see ma  EF context for connection string because if you have mysql running on different port then 80 you cannot use the connection string in the tutorial. you have to add nuget package for Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql version 2.2.0 so that will work in asp.net core 2.2. I done all in visual studio code with dotnet cli bud i also add the solution to the project so that I can open it in visual studio.... I hope this will help someone following that great tutorial.
this is a work in progress.... I'll continue follow this tutorial by adding logging, hash ecc....
